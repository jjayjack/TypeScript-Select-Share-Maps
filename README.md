# TypeScript-Select-Share-Maps

## About

Within this application we want to be able to type in an address, look up the address, convert the address to coordinates (Google API call), and render coordinates on a map (Google Maps STK). Besides the API calls we will be using two 3rd party libraries, HTTP Sending Library and Google Maps library.
